/**
 * The SDK refuses to send credentials to a non-TLS token endpoint
 * whose host is outside its loopback exemption (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1` /
 * `::1`), throwing `InsecureTokenEndpointError` from inside
 * `executeTokenRequest`.
 *
 * That error is **terminal by design**. It does not extend `OAuthError`, and
 * `auth()` special-cases it to rethrow rather than fall through to a fresh
 * `/authorize` redirect — so nothing the Inspector does can make a retry
 * succeed. Recognizing it is what lets the UI say so, instead of offering a
 * "Re-authenticate" affordance that can only fail the same way (#2280).
 *
 * The check is not a fix for `*.localhost` (#1944): the exemption list lives in
 * the SDK and takes no options, so widening it has to happen upstream
 * (typescript-sdk#2591). This is about how the refusal is *reported* — which
 * matters for every endpoint outside that exemption, `host.docker.internal` and
 * LAN hostnames included, not only the `.localhost` case.

/**
 * Recognize the SDK's `InsecureTokenEndpointError` itself (not a wrapper).
 *
 * Uses the SDK's own `isInstance` predicate, which is cross-copy safe by
 * construction: the SDK stamps each instance with a brand set keyed by
 * `Symbol.for("mcp.sdk.errorBrands")` and overrides `Symbol.hasInstance` to
 * consult it, so an error thrown by a different bundled copy still matches.
 * (The brand constant is `static`, so it is never reachable as `err.mcpBrand`
 * on an instance — don't check that property.)
 *
 * The `name` comparison is the same deliberate serialization fallback
 * `isAuthorizationServerMismatchShape` carries in `issuerBinding.ts`. Today the
 * web client runs `auth()` in the browser so no boundary is crossed, but a JSON
 * hop drops the prototype and the brand set while preserving `name` and
 * `tokenEndpoint`, and that is the case this arm exists for.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It does not cover `structuredClone`, and cannot.** That algorithm
 * normalizes a custom `Error` subclass back to `Error` — `name` becomes
 * `"Error"` and own properties like `tokenEndpoint` are dropped entirely — so
 * nothing survives for either arm to match on. A caller who routes this error
 * through `structuredClone` (or `postMessage`, which uses it) will silently get
 * the generic retryable handling back. Serialize the fields explicitly across
 * such a boundary rather than relying on this classifier.
