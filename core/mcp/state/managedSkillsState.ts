/**
 * ManagedSkillsState: holds the full skill list (SEP-2640), in sync with the
 * server. Loaded on connect, cleared on disconnect, re-walked on refresh.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `ManagedListState` subclass, despite the family
 * resemblance. That base is built around two things the Skills extension does
 * not have: a top-level `ServerCapabilities` key to gate on (skills is a
 * *server-declared extension*, read from `capabilities.extensions`), and a
 * per-list `list_changed` notification to debounce and turn into a sidebar
 * indicator (SEP-2640 defines none). Subclassing would mean widening the base's
 * capability gate and inventing a list-changed event nothing dispatches — two
 * changes to shared machinery to serve one caller. The cursor walk below is the
 * only behavior actually shared, and it is nine lines.
 *
 * The walk is done here rather than through an SDK `listAll*` verb for the same
 * reason the request is a plain `client.request`: the SDK has no high-level verb
 * for a consumer-owned extension method, so there is no cache-aware wrapper to
 * delegate to and no `cacheMode` to honor.
 *
 * ⚠️ **There is deliberately no `PagedSkillsState`, so the `paginatedLists`
 * server setting does not apply to Skills (#2248).** Tools, prompts and
 * resources each have a paged counterpart that setting switches them to; skills
 * does not, and the reason is not that the walk is cheap.
 *
 * It is that **every consumer of this list is a whole-catalog verdict.** The
 * Skills screen's conformance summary, and the CLI's `--verify` exit code, are
 * statements about the catalog: "this server's skills conform". Computed over
 * page one of three, that statement is *wrong* — it reports a clean catalog
 * while the tampered digest sits on page three, and reports it with exactly the
 * confidence of a real pass. Paging the other lists costs a reader some rows;
 * paging this one would make the tool's own output untrue. The setting exists
 * to let a user watch a server's pagination work, and this list's page count is
 * surfaced instead (`getPagination`, rendered by both the web screen and the
 * TUI pane), which serves that purpose without staking a verdict on a partial
 * read.
 *
 * The cost argument, which is the one #2248 asked about, points the same way
 * and is secondary: SEP-2640 makes a listing entry a *complete* manifest —
 * verbatim frontmatter and the full `resources` set with digests — precisely so
 * that "a host that pages through the listing has, in that one pass, everything
 * it needs … there is no second round-trip per skill". A full walk is the
 * access pattern the wire format was designed for. Revisit if a real server
 * turns up whose catalog makes the walk painful; the guards this walk already
 * carries (`SKILLS_MAX_PAGES`, the repeated-cursor check) are what bound it
 * until then.
