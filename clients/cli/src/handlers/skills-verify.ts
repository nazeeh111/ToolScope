/**
 * `--verify`: the scriptable SEP-2640 conformance report (#2248).
 *
 * The Skills screen in the web client can verify a skill, but only by hand, one
 * file at a time, in a browser. A server author wants the same verdict in CI,
 * over the whole catalog, with an exit code — which is exactly the argument
 * `--strict` makes for the tool-schema lint, so this follows that handler's
 * shape rather than inventing a second one.
 *
 * The walk itself is `core/mcp/skillsVerification.ts`, shared with the TUI's
 * Skills pane. What is left here is presentation: the one-line stderr summary,
 * which is a CLI concern and nothing else's.
