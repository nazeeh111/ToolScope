/**
 * Unit coverage for the pagination cursor every list adapter — `tools/list`,
 * `prompts/list`, `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`, `tasks/list` —
 * puts on the wire (#2220).
 *
 * An MCP cursor is an **opaque string**: the spec places no constraint on its
 * content, so `""` is a `nextCursor` a server may legitimately hand back and
 * the client is required to send verbatim. Four adapters used to build their
 * params with a truthiness check, which cannot distinguish "no cursor" from
 * "the cursor is the empty string" — so they dropped `""` and silently
 * re-requested page one. Nothing surfaced an error, because the request was
 * well-formed; it just asked the wrong question.
 *
 * The outbound params are therefore the whole assertion here: what each case
 * pins is that `""` survives and that a genuinely absent cursor still sends no
 * `cursor` key at all. The SDK client is stubbed rather than connected — the
 * decision under test is made entirely in `InspectorClient`.
